title: Selecting and summarizing columns
description: >-
  This chapter provides a brief introduction to working with relational
  databases. You'll learn about their structure, how to talk about them using
  database lingo, and how to begin an analysis by using simple SQL commands to
  select and summarize columns from database tables.

## Introduction

* Motivating example (case study preview)
* Why not just use R/Python/etc?
  * Memory
  * Speed
  * Centralization
  * Access control
  * DMBS tools
  * ...?
* Database vocabulary (in context of example; make spreadsheet analogies)
  * Database (~ spreadsheet)
  * Tables (~ worksheet)
  * Columns & records (a.k.a. records) (~ columns & rows)
  * Fields (~ cells)
* Basic SQL syntax
  * Not case-sensitive
  * End statement with semicolon
  * Stylistic conventions (?)
* SELECT
* DISTINCT

## Why use relational databases?

Q: Which of the following is NOT a good reason to use relational databases?
A: They are good at handling unstructured data

## Simple SELECT statements

Single column, multiple columns, all columns (*). Order matters! Finish with embedded MCE asking for specific value from last query

## Combine SELECT with DISTINCT

Select all distinct values of column_name with SELECT DISTINCT. Repeat with multiple columns. Follow with embedded MCE to test interpretation

## Select the proper SELECT

(Test for style and syntax)

Q: Which of the following queries returns a list of every date on which at least one person read a blog post?
A: 
SELECT DISTINCT date_read
FROM reads;

## Aggregate functions

* Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name)
* Combining COUNT with DISTINCT
* SUM
* AVG
* MIN
* MAX

## COUNT

COUNT(*) counts NULLs, COUNT(column_name) excludes NULLs

## Combine COUNT with DISTINCT

A couple useful examples of COUNT(DISTINCT column_name)

## Fun with aggregate functions

Use AVE, MIN, MAX, SUM on duration column from reads table

*** =solution
```{r}

## Simple math in SQL

* Doing basic arithmetic on columns (+, -, *, /, %)
* Introduce column aliases via AS as a way to name columns in query result. Will become even more useful later in the course
* ROUND, FLOOR, CEILING

## From seconds to minutes

Compute AVG and SUM of reading time in minutes instead of seconds, using aliases to name resulting columns. Do the same, but ROUND one of the columns to nearest integer

## How long have you been here?

First return all columns from the authors table, then add a column which gives the number of years each author has been writing for the blog (i.e. 2017 - year_joined)
