title: Selecting and summarizing columns
description: >-
  This chapter provides a brief introduction to working with relational
  databases. You'll learn about their structure, how to talk about them using
  database lingo, and how to begin an analysis by using simple SQL commands to
  select and summarize columns from database tables.

## Introducing SQL

- Motivating example: preview of Citi Bike case study. - Why not just use R / Python?
  - Memory
  - Speed
  - Centralization
  - Acesss control
  - DBMS tools
  - Scalability
- Vocabulary: comparing to spreadsheet
  - Database: like a spreadsheet
  - Table: like a worksheet
  - Columns / Rows: same concept
  - Fields: cells
  - Entities:
  - Attributes:
- Basic SQL syntax
  - We're using PostgreSQL
  - Not case sensitive
  - Statements end with semi-colon
  - Brief intro to order of operations
- Introducing SELECT, SELECT * and DISTINCT - Brief note on LIMIT
