## Introduction

* Motivating example (case study preview)
* Why not just use R/Python/etc?
  * Memory
  * Speed
  * Centralization
  * Access control
  * DMBS tools
  * ...?
* Database vocabulary (in context of example; make spreadsheet analogies)
  * Database (~ spreadsheet)
  * Tables (~ worksheet)
  * Columns & records (a.k.a. records) (~ columns & rows)
  * Fields (~ cells)
* Basic SQL syntax
  * Not case-sensitive
  * End statement with semicolon
  * Stylistic conventions (?)
* SELECT
* DISTINCT

## Simple SELECT statements

Single column, multiple columns, all columns (*). Order matters! Finish with embedded MCE asking for specific value from last query

## Combine SELECT with DISTINCT

Select all distinct values of column_name with SELECT DISTINCT. Repeat with multiple columns. Follow with embedded MCE to test interpretation

## Select the proper SELECT

(Test for style and syntax)

Q: Which of the following is the proper way to select all distinct values of column_name from the table_name table?
A: 
SELECT DISTINCT column_name
FROM table_name;

## Aggregate functions

* Difference between COUNT(*) and COUNT(column_name)
* Combining COUNT with DISTINCT
* SUM
* AVG
* MIN
* MAX
