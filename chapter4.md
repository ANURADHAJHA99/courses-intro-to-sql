title: 'Case Study: Citi Bike In New York City'
description: >-
  This chapter gives you an opportunity to apply everything you've learned in
  the first three chapters to real-world data! You'll be working with a database
  that contains information on millions of individual bike share trips in New
  York City in 2015, along with the stations the bikes belong to, and daily
  weather metrics recorded from Central Park during the same time period.
