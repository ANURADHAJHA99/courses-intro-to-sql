  - chapter_title: Selecting and summarizing columns
    chapter_description: >-
      This chapter provides a brief introduction to working with relational
      databases. You'll learn about their structure, how to talk about them
      using database lingo, and how to begin an analysis by using simple SQL
      commands to select and summarize columns from database tables.

      This chapter builds on the first by teaching you not only how to select
      and summarize columns of interest, but to filter tables for records
      satisfying some criteria of interest. You'll learn how to use basic
      comparison operators, combine multiple criteria, match patterns in text,
      and much more.

  - chapter_title: Sorting and grouping
    chapter_description: >-
      Now that you've learned how to select the rows and columns you're most
      interested in, you'll take your analyses to the next level by learning how
      to sort and group tables by variables of interest. In particular, you'll
      see how to combine GROUP BY with aggregate functions like SUM and AVG to
      summarize your data within groupsâ€”a very powerful paradigm!

    chapter_description: >-
      This chapter gives you an opportunity to apply everything you've learned
      in the first three chapters to real-world data! You'll be working with a
      database that contains information on millions of individual bike share
      trips in New York City in 2016, along with the stations the bikes belong
      to, and daily weather metrics recorded from Central Park of the same time
      period.
