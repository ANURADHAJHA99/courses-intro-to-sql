title: Sorting and Grouping
description: >-
  Now that you've learned how to select the rows and columns you're most
  interested in, you'll take your analyses to the next level by learning how to
  sort and group tables by variables of interest. In particular, you'll see how
  to combine GROUP BY with aggregate functions like SUM and AVG to summarize
  your data within groups â€” a very powerful paradigm!

## ORDER BY in the courtroom

In SQL, the `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order. By default `ORDER BY` will sort in ascending order. If you want to sort the results in descending order, you use the `DESC` keyword. 

For example, 

```
SELECT title 
FROM films 
ORDER BY release_year;
```

will give you the titles of films sorted by release year, from newest to oldest. 

What way does `ORDER BY` sort results by default?

*** =instructions
- Alphabetically 
- Descending
- Ascending
- In order of creation date

*** =hint
By default, `ORDER BY` behaves as if it was using the `ASC` keyword.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
```

*** =sct
```{python}
success_msg = 'Correct!'
alphabetically = 'Incorrect. Although results may be in alphabetical order, how would we order numbers alphabetically?'
descending = 'Incorrect. Results are not ordered descending by default.'
creation = 'Incorrect. Results are not ordered by creation date by default.'

Ex().test_mc(3, [alphabetically, descending, success_msg, creation])
```

## Sorting multiple columns

`ORDER BY` can also be used to sort on multiple columns! `ORDER BY` will sort by the first column specified, then sort by the next and so on. 

For example,

```
SELECT birthdate, name
FROM people 
ORDER BY birthdate, name;
```

will sort the birth dates first (oldest to newest), and then sort the names in alphabetical order. 

Try out using `ORDER BY` to sort multiple columns! Remember, to specify multiple columns, just separate the column names with a comma.

## Introduction to GROUP BY

In SQL, `GROUP BY` allows you to group a result set by one or more columns. `GROUP BY` is used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()` or `MAX`. For example, 

```
SELECT title, COUNT(title) 
FROM films 
GROUP BY release_year;
``` 

will give you the number of films released in each year.

What is `GROUP BY` used for?

*** =instructions
- Sorting results by column
- Sorting results by creation order
- Sorting results in alphabetical order
- Sorting results from aggregate functions

*** =hint
You use `GROUP BY` when you want to compute results from many records.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{python}
connect('postgresql', 'films')
```

*** =sct
```{python}
success_msg = 'Correct! `GROUP BY` is speficially for sorting the results of aggregate functions.'
one = 'Incorrect. While `GROUP BY` does sort by column, we could just use `ORDER BY` for this.
two = 'Incorrect.'
three = 'Incorrect. While `GROUP BY` can sort in alphabetical order, we could just use `ORDER BY` for this.

Ex().test_mc(4, [msg2, msg2, msg2, success_msg])
```

## HAVING a great time

In SQL, `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregate functions. To deal with this, you can instead use the `HAVING` keyword. 

For example, 

```
SELECT release_year 
FROM films 
GROUP BY release_year 
HAVING COUNT(title) > 10;
```

will show only those years in which more than 10 films were released.

Why do we need the `HAVING` keyword?

*** =instructions
- To order by creation date
- To sort using textual values
- To sort using numeric values
- `WHERE` cannot be used with aggregate functions

*** =hint
What kind of functions can `WHERE` not be used with?
