title: Sorting and Grouping
description: >-
  Now that you've learned how to select the rows and columns you're most
  interested in, you'll take your analyses to the next level by learning how to
  sort and group tables by variables of interest. In particular, you'll see how
  to combine GROUP BY with aggregate functions like SUM and AVG to summarize
  your data within groups â€” a very powerful paradigm!
