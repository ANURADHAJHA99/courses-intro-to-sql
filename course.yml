title: Intro to SQL for Data Science
description: "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable insights. 
  Much of the world\'s raw data—from electronic medical records to customer transaction 
  histories—lives in organized collections of tables called <em>relational databases</em>. 
  Therefore, to be an effective data scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract 
  data from these databases using a language called SQL (pronounced <em>ess-que-ell</em>, or 
  <em>sequel</em>). This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with 
  databases, then finishes with a real-world case study where you\'ll apply your new
  database wizardry to analyze New York City Bike data!"
