title: Intro to SQL for Data Science
description: "The role of a data scientist is to turn raw data into actionable
  insights. Much of the world's raw data—from electronic medical records to
  customer transaction histories—lives in organized collections of tables
  called <i>relational databases</i>. Therefore, to be an effective data
  scientist, you must know how to wrangle and extract data from these databases
  using a language called SQL (pronounced <i>ess-que-ell</i>, or <i>sequel</i>).
  This course teaches you everything you need to know to begin working with
  databases today!"
